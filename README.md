If there are any problems or suggestions that you would like to add, just comment on one of those and I'll try to get around to it

What does this add specifically?
Adds these new implants into the game, randomly generated the same way any archotech item is:
  Archotech Ears
  Archotech Stomach
  Archotech Liver
  Archotech Kidneys
  Archotech Lungs
  Archotech Heart
  Advanced Archotech Legs (See below)
  Advanced Archotech Arms (See below)
  Archotech Death Claw (See below)
  Archotech Obliterator (See Below
  Archotech Brain Melder (See below)

All these increase the stats of said part by the archotech equivalent.

The Advanced Archotech Legs are a highly advanced version of the already highly advanced archotech legs. They are 4 times more expensive than regular ones, but also give a much higher mobility boost compared to the normal archotech legs.

The Advanced Archotech Arms do the same thing as the advanced legs do, but for arms. 

The Archotech Death Claw is a high powered Power claw, basically. For the Archotech. It's much more expensive than any other Archotech item as it serves as an archotech arm and a power claw simultaneosly.

The Archotech Brain Melder is a better pain stopper and joy giver. It increases conciousness, removes pain, gives joy and heals scars on the brain. It's incredibly useful for any situation. Have fun!
